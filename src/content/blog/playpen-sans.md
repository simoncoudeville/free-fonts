Digital excellence meets casual handwriting, with a character shuffler and enough personality to make the little things shine. Playpen Sans has seven versions of each casual character, a built-in shuffler so no single shape is repeated in close proximity, and emojis. The result is text with spontaneous inconsistencies that feel fun and organic.
