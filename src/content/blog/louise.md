The character Louise was created as part of the Reviving Ange Degheest project. During her years of teaching at the School of Fine Arts in Rennes, between 1961 and 1979, Ange Degheest returned to engraving and the work of Robert Cordier, a 17th-century engraver who had left a mark on her during her apprenticeship at Shom. In addition to geographical maps, she engraved models of writing from master calligraphers, especially the Italian letters of Louis Barbedor, which inspired Ange Degheest to create a new typeface. She emphasized the monolinear aspect of the script and built its design on a mechanical structure, reminiscent of neon sign aesthetics.

In 1972, Ange Degheest offered this typeface to Mecanorma, a French company specializing in graphic supplies that was thriving at the time. Louise would be distributed on letter transfer sheets and become part of the original typefaces in the Norma Type catalog. The name of the typeface is a direct reference to Barbedor's first name and also to the literary figure Louise Michel, whom Ange Degheest was an avid reader of.
